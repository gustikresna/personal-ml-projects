Some of the features are quite obscure, especially for those without prior medical knowledge. In order to understand each variable to ease the data analysis, I have searched simple explanation from multiple sources.\n\nVariable Explanation :\n1. **`age`** : person's age in years\n2. **`sex`** : person's gender\n    * *0 = female*\n    * *1 = male*\n\n3. **`cp`** : chest pain\n    * *0 = asymptomatic*\n        \n        Showing no sign of symptoms. Nearly half of all heart attacks have no symptoms at all. They are described as silent because when they occur, their symptoms lack the intensity of a classic heart attack, such as extreme chest pain and pressure; stabbing pain in the arm, neck, or jaw; sudden shortness of breath; sweating, and dizziness. [Source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-danger-of-silent-heart-attacks)\n\n    * *1 = atypical angina*\n\n        Atypical (probable) angina chest pain applies when 2 out of 3 criteria of typical angina are present, which are further explained in typical angina. [Source](https://www.timeofcare.com/typical-vs-atypical-chest-pain)\n    \n    * *2 = non anginal pain*\n\n        Chest pain that is not caused by angina. [Source](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15851-gerd-non-cardiac-chest-pain)\n\n    * *3 = typical angina*\n    \n        Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, which also called angina pectoris. It is often described as squeezing, pressure, tightness or pain in the chest. Typical (classic) angina chest pain consists of (1) Substernal chest pain or discomfort that is (2) Provoked by exertion or emotional stress and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine (or both). [Source](https://www.timeofcare.com/typical-vs-atypical-chest-pain)\n\n4. **`trestbps`** : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n\n Blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is blood pressure that is higher than normal. The higher the blood pressure levels, the more risk for other health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm)\n\n5. **`chol`** : serum cholesterol in mg/dl\n\n Cholesterol is required to build cells and make vitamins and other hormones. But too much cholesterol can pose a problem. When there is too much cholesterol in the blood, it builds up in the walls of the arteries. The arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked. The blood carries oxygen to the heart, and if not enough blood and oxygen reach your heart, you may suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a blockage, the result is a heart attack. [Source](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-lower-cholesterol-risk)\n\n6. **`fbs`** : fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\n\n This measures blood sugar level after an overnight fasting. People with a fasting blood sugar level of 100-125 mg/dl has an adjusted nearly 300% increase higher risk of having coronary heart disease than people with a level below 79 mg/dl. [Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451)\n\n7. **`restcg`** : resting electrocardiographic results\n \n Resting electrocardiography (ECG) is performed while patient lying down in a comfortable position. During this time, a series of electrodes, attached to your skin with small sticky pads, will be recording the electrical activity going on in your heart.\n\n The information they gather is transmitted back to the ECG machine, which will produce a chart or electrocardiogram showing how the electrical activity changes over time. When we look at this rest ECG chart, we can identify peaks and valleys that show when the upper and lower chambers of your heart are contracting and relaxing. \n\n Specific heart disorders can produce recognisable patterns on the ECG. It can be used to investigate symptoms of a possible heart problem, such as chest pain, palpitations (suddenly noticeable heartbeats), dizziness and shortness of breath. [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electrocardiogram/)\n\n The compositions of ECG results are displayed below :\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://ekg.md/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pediatric-ST-Segment-e1523655945228.jpg\" title=\"ECG results composition\" width=\"250\" height=\"220\">\n\n    * *0 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria*\n\n        Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a term for a heart’s left pumping chamber that has thickened and may not be pumping efficiently. LVH is the most potent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the hypertensive population, and is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, sudden death, heart failure and stroke. [Source](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-valve-problems-and-disease/heart-valve-problems-and-causes/what-is-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh)\n\n    * *1 = normal*\n        \n        If the heart is healthy, the peaks will form a characteristic pattern and they will occur at a regular rate of between 60 and 100 beats per minute. [Source](https://www.cardiacscreen.co.uk/rest-ecg.php)\n\n    * *2 = having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)* \n\n        T-wave inversions with concomitant ST-segment deviations is typical of ischemia. However, it is actually the ST-segment deviations that reflects the ischemia, which is a restriction in blood supply to any tissues, muscle group, or organ of the body, causing a shortage of oxygen. When arteries are narrowed, less blood and oxygen reaches the heart muscle. This is also called coronary artery disease and coronary heart disease that could lead to heart attack. [Source](https://ecgwaves.com/topic/t-wave-negative-inversions-hyperacute-wellens-sign-de-winters/)\n\n\n8. **`thalach`**: The person's maximum heart rate achieved\n\n The heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times the heart beats in 1 minute. Heart rates vary from person to person. It’s lower when you’re at rest and higher when you exercise. Maximum heart rate is the fastest the heart can beat and still pump blood effectively through the body. As you age, your maximum heart rate drops. This means that your heart is weaker and more susceptible to damage, and you can’t exercise as fast over distance as you could when you were younger. [Source](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/watching-rate-monitor)\n\n9. **`exang`** : exercise induced angina\n Exercise-induced angina is a common complaint of cardiac patients, particularly when exercising. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4068968/)\n\n    * *0 = no*\n    * *1 = yes*\n\n10. **`oldpeak`** : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot)\n\n Exercise induced ST segment depression is considered a reliable ECG finding for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis, a gradual narrowing or closing of arteries that supply the heart with blood. ST segments more than 1 to 2 mm lower than baseline are termed depressed. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1768611/)\n\n11. **`slope`** : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n\n ST segment depressions caused by ischemia are characterized by a horizontal or downslopping ST segment. [Source](https://ecgwaves.com/topic/ecg-st-segment-depression-ischemia-infarction-differential-diagnoses/)\n\n    * *0 = downsloping*\n    * *1 = flat*\n    * *2 = upsloping*\n\n12. **`ca`** : number of major vessels (0–3) coloured by fluoroscopy\n\n Fluoroscopy is a study of moving body structures. A continuous X-ray beam is passed through the body part being examined. The beam is transmitted to a TV-like monitor so that the body part and its motion can be seen in detail. One of the application of fluoroscopy is cardiac catheterization.\n\n Cardiac catheterization is an invasive imaging procedure that allows your doctor to evaluate your heart function. During a cardiac catheterization, a long, narrow tube called a catheter is inserted through a plastic introducer sheath (a short, hollow tube that is inserted into a blood vessel in your leg or arm). The catheter is guided through the blood vessel to the coronary arteries with the aid of a special x-ray machine.\n\n Contrast material is injected through the catheter and x-ray movies are created as the contrast material moves through the heart’s chambers, valves and major vessels. This part of the procedure is called a coronary angiogram (or coronary angiography). The digital photographs of the contrast material are used to identify the site of the narrowing or blockage in the coronary artery. [Source](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/16832-cardiac-catheterization)\n\n13. **`thal`** : thallium stress test result\n\n A thallium stress test is a nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows into your heart while you’re exercising or at rest. This test is also called a cardiac or nuclear stress test.\n\n During the procedure, a liquid with a small amount of radioactivity called a radioisotope is administered into one of your veins. The radioisotope will flow through your bloodstream and end up in your heart. Once the radiation is in your heart, a special camera called a gamma camera can detect the radiation and reveal any issues your heart muscle is having.\n\n When patients undergo a thallium stress test, the finding of a reversible defect involving poor perfusion is used to diagnose myocardium in jeopardy, and a fixed thallium defect implies an old infarction.
